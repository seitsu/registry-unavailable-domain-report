Unavailable Domain Report
=================

## Goal
The goal was to draft an Unavailable Domain Report based on the [Report Structure] and shall be delivered through the [Reporting Repository].

## Status
The idea to create the Repository, the Structure and numerous Reports was first raised by the ICANN Registrar Stakeholder Group ([RrSG]) Technical and Operational ([TechOps]) Subcommittee, and further discussed and eventually approved in the [CPH TechOps] Group.

This document is **not active** anymore. We abandoned it in favor of [Simple Registration Reporting].

## Validation
The draft is written in IETF RFC style. Therefore, you may validate this [draft] with https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.
